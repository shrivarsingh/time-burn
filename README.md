Simple Time Calculation App for Android.

Created using Android studio for GADS (Google Africa Developer Scolarship) Community Project 2020.

Problem Statement:
REMOTE WORK FOR TRADITIONAL WORKSPACES
Transition to remote work hasn’t been easy on companies and employees with traditional workspaces.
They are forced to reduce the office attendance ratio hence work for a certain number of = days at the office in a week.
This definitely reduces the employee and company’s productivity as a whole,
Can you build a solution that helps a traditional workspace company in your community transition to partially or fully remote?

Solution:
Build an Application that can divide the hours you need to work by adding a break times.

Application:
-Click on Start Time to set the time to start work.
-Move the Slider next to the hours to work value to set the hours to work.
-Click on the clock button to calculate the times you need to work and take a break.
-The cycle is based on 90 min of work and 15 min of break.
Note: Break times are not counted as hours to work.
